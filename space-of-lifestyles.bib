	abstract = {This chapter discusses interpreting axes in multiple correspondence analyses. It also discusses the method of the contributions of points and deviations developed for multiple correspondence analyses (MCA) that directly extends the existing aids to interpretation. In analysis of variance (ANOVA) terms, contributions of points to an axis are simply parts of variance accounted for by points. The method of the contributions of points and deviations readily applies, with appropriate modifications, to the interpretation of principal axes of all kinds of structured multidimensional data. In MCA, investigating the cloud of individuals—together with its subclouds and derived clouds (modality mean points)—leads to detailed interpretations by the examination of composite modalities. A general claim underlying this chapter is that the use of specific comparisons, a tool borrowed from ANOVA, should considerably enrich the usual aids for interpretation in the geometric data analysis. The method of the contributions of points and deviations provides the first step in this direction.},

@book{hjellbrekke_multiple_2018,
	title = {Multiple {Correspondence} {Analysis} for the {Social} {Sciences}},
	isbn = {978-1-138-69971-7},
	abstract = {Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) is a statistical technique that first and foremost has become known through the work of the late Pierre Bourdieu (1930–2002). This book will introduce readers to the fundamental properties, procedures and rules of interpretation of the most commonly used forms of correspondence analysis. The book is written as a non-technical introduction, intended for the advanced undergraduate level and onwards.
MCA represents and models data sets as clouds of points in a multidimensional Euclidean space. The interpretation of the data is based on these clouds of points. In seven chapters, this non-technical book will provide the reader with a comprehensive introduction and the needed knowledge to do analyses on his/her own: CA, MCA, specific MCA, the integration of MCA and variance analysis, of MCA and ascending hierarchical cluster analysis and class-specific MCA on subgroups. Special attention will be given to the construction of social spaces, to the construction of typologies and to group internal oppositions.
This is a book on data analysis for the social sciences rather than a book on statistics. The main emphasis is on how to apply MCA to the analysis of practical research questions. It does not require a solid understanding of statistics and/or mathematics, and provides the reader with the needed knowledge to do analyses on his/her own.

	abstract = {This paper combines three exploratory data analysis methods, principal component methods, hierarchical clustering and partitioning, to enrich the description of the data. Principal component methods are used as preprocessing step for the clustering in order to denoise the data, transform categorical data in continuous ones or balanced groups of variables. The principal component representation is also used to visualize the hierarchical tree and/or the partition in a 3D-map which allows to better understand the data. The proposed methodology is available in the HCPC (Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components) function of the FactoMineR package.},

This book argues that the social world functions simultaneously as a system of power relations and as a symbolic system in which minute distinctions of taste become the basis for social judgement.No judgement of taste is innocent - we are all snobs. Pierre Bourdieu's Distinction brilliantly illuminates the social pretentions of the middle classes in the modern world, focusing on the tastes and preferences of the French bourgeoisie. First published in 1979, the book is at once a vast ethnography of contemporary France and a dissection of the bourgeois mind. In the course of everyday life we constantly choose between what we find aesthetically pleasing, and what we consider tacky, merely trendy, or ugly. Taste is not pure. Bourdieu demonstrates that our different aesthetic choices are all distinctions - that is, choices made in opposition to those made by other classes. This fascinating work argues that the social world functions simultaneously as a system of power relations and as a symbolic system in which minute distinctions of taste become the basis for social judgement.},

	abstract = {•The transformation of the space of lifestyles in Switzerland is tracked using trend data, repeated MCAs, cluster analyses, and regression analyses.•The main dimensions of the space of lifestyles (engagement vs. disengagement, highbrow vs. popular) are quite stable over time.•Structural correlates of lifestyle patterns do change over time; the share of inactive cultural consumers decreases.•Indicators of vertical social position are correlated with broad cultural engagement today; age emerged as the main structuring factor of highbrow-popular disparities.•Overall, correlations between the space of lifestyles and the space of social positions do not decrease over time.
In the present study we trace transformations of the Swiss space of lifestyles during the past four decades. The sociological discussion suggests that lifestyle practices were once structured by a highbrow-lowbrow distinction, whereas today cultural omnivorism, eclecticism, broad engagement, or cosmopolitanism should be prevalent. Furthermore, Bourdieu’s homology thesis claims that cultural consumption is closely linked with class structures, which is contested by recent individualisation arguments. So, we ask two questions here: First, what are the main axes of the Swiss space of lifestyles and how do they develop over time? Second, how does the association between the space of lifestyles and the space of social positions evolve over time? We find that cultural practices in Switzerland are primarily structured by a dimension differentiating between engagement in a wide range of activities and disengagement, followed, secondly, by a highbrow-popular distinction. Accordingly, we identify an “inactive”, an “intense highbrow” and a “moderate eclectic” consumption pattern. Although this configuration is quite stable over time, structural correlates of lifestyles are changing. Most importantly, indicators of vertical social position like education or occupational status are correlated with broad cultural engagement today, whereas they have been correlated with highbrow activities in the 1970s. Instead, age emerged as the main structuring factor of highbrow-popular disparities.},
