It also discusses the method of the contributions of points and deviations developed for multiple correspondence analyses (MCA) that directly extends the existing aids to interpretation. In analysis of variance (ANOVA) terms, contributions of points to an axis are simply parts of variance accounted for by points. The method of the contributions of points and deviations readily applies, with appropriate modifications, to the interpretation of principal axes of all kinds of structured multidimensional data. In MCA, investigating the cloud of individuals—together with its subclouds and derived clouds (modality mean points)—leads to detailed interpretations by the examination of composite modalities. A general claim underlying this chapter is that the use of specific comparisons, a tool borrowed from ANOVA, should considerably enrich the usual aids for interpretation in the geometric data analysis. The method of the contributions of points and deviations provides the first step in this direction.},

	abstract = {Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) is a statistical technique that first and foremost has become known through the work of the late Pierre Bourdieu (1930–2002). This book will introduce readers to the fundamental properties, procedures and rules of interpretation of the most commonly used forms of correspondence analysis. The book is written as a non-technical introduction, intended for the advanced undergraduate level and onwards.
MCA represents and models data sets as clouds of points in a multidimensional Euclidean space. The interpretation of the data is based on these clouds of points. In seven chapters, this non-technical book will provide the reader with a comprehensive introduction and the needed knowledge to do analyses on his/her own: CA, MCA, specific MCA, the integration of MCA and variance analysis, of MCA and ascending hierarchical cluster analysis and class-specific MCA on subgroups. Special attention will be given to the construction of social spaces, to the construction of typologies and to group internal oppositions.
This is a book on data analysis for the social sciences rather than a book on statistics. The main emphasis is on how to apply MCA to the analysis of practical research questions. It does not require a solid understanding of statistics and/or mathematics, and provides the reader with the needed knowledge to do analyses on his/her own.

Pierre Bourdieu's Distinction brilliantly illuminates the social pretentions of the middle classes in the modern world, focusing on the tastes and preferences of the French bourgeoisie. First published in 1979, the book is at once a vast ethnography of contemporary France and a dissection of the bourgeois mind. In the course of everyday life we constantly choose between what we find aesthetically pleasing, and what we consider tacky, merely trendy, or ugly. Taste is not pure. Bourdieu demonstrates that our different aesthetic choices are all distinctions - that is, choices made in opposition to those made by other classes. This fascinating work argues that the social world functions simultaneously as a system of power relations and as a symbolic system in which minute distinctions of taste become the basis for social judgement.},

	abstract = {•The transformation of the space of lifestyles in Switzerland is tracked using trend data, repeated MCAs, cluster analyses, and regression analyses.•The main dimensions of the space of lifestyles (engagement vs. disengagement, highbrow vs. popular) are quite stable over time.•Structural correlates of lifestyle patterns do change over time; the share of inactive cultural consumers decreases.•Indicators of vertical social position are correlated with broad cultural engagement today; age emerged as the main structuring factor of highbrow-popular disparities.•Overall, correlations between the space of lifestyles and the space of social positions do not decrease over time.
In the present study we trace transformations of the Swiss space of lifestyles during the past four decades. The sociological discussion suggests that lifestyle practices were once structured by a highbrow-lowbrow distinction, whereas today cultural omnivorism, eclecticism, broad engagement, or cosmopolitanism should be prevalent. Furthermore, Bourdieu’s homology thesis claims that cultural consumption is closely linked with class structures, which is contested by recent individualisation arguments. So, we ask two questions here: First, what are the main axes of the Swiss space of lifestyles and how do they develop over time? Second, how does the association between the space of lifestyles and the space of social positions evolve over time? We find that cultural practices in Switzerland are primarily structured by a dimension differentiating between engagement in a wide range of activities and disengagement, followed, secondly, by a highbrow-popular distinction. Accordingly, we identify an “inactive”, an “intense highbrow” and a “moderate eclectic” consumption pattern. Although this configuration is quite stable over time, structural correlates of lifestyles are changing. Most importantly, indicators of vertical social position like education or occupational status are correlated with broad cultural engagement today, whereas they have been correlated with highbrow activities in the 1970s. Instead, age emerged as the main structuring factor of highbrow-popular disparities.},

Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) has been used to address this issue.

In order to assess the extent to which contemporary cultural lifestyles reflect a culture of distinction or a culture of openness, this study maps the structure of cultural lifestyles in Flanders, Belgium. Information on a broad range of cultural behaviors (participation) and dispositions (what is important in cultural activities) from 2849 respondents is analyzed and linked to a set of indicators of social position. By means of Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), three structuring dimensions are found. The first is an engagement–disengagement axis—distinguishing an active and open-minded lifestyle versus a more passive, homebound way of living. The second dimension contrasts a preference for contemplation and legitimate arts with a preference for adventure and action. The third axis adds an opposition between a pronounced openness to new things and a more neutral stance. Cultural and economic capital are primarily associated with axis one, age with axis two. The third dimension is linked to different specific combinations of social categories, demonstrating that respondents have distinct ways of showing the underlying trait of openness depending on their position in the social space—omnivorousness is only one of its expressions linked to younger people with much cultural capital.},

Based on recent French data on music listening habits, this article examines Bourdieu's theoretical legacy by means of a multi-correspondence analysis of people's listening habits in various musical genres. The analysis basically invalidates Bourdieu's strict homology hypothesis and corroborates Peterson's omnivore/univore thesis as far as it is not possible to establish an unequivocal correspondence between any musical genre and a social group or to confirm that upper-class and high-status groups tend to distinguish themselves by the variety of their musical consumption. In that sense, as omnivorousness tends to become a distinctive criteria, Bourdieu's thesis seems only partially challenged by this new theoretical framework, as far as cultural consumption remains socially stratified. Finally, two competing hypotheses may be proposed on the meaning of the predominantly omnivorous behavior of the upper classes and highest social status groups. First, the omnivorous musical consumer can be seen as an outcome of social mobility and school massification which is introducing people from increasingly heterogeneous social and cultural backgrounds into elites. Second, eclecticism can be understood as a generic disposition towards culture characterized by tolerance and openness to diversity which tends to embody the modern quintessence of distinction.},

Culture, Class, Distinction is major contribution to international debates regarding the role of cultural capital in relation to modern forms of inequality. Drawing on a national study of the organisation of cultural practices in contemporary Britain, the authors review Bourdieu’s classic study of the relationships between culture and class in the light of subsequent debates.
In doing so they re-appraise the relationships between class, gender and ethnicity, music, film, television, literary, and arts consumption, the organisation of sporting and culinary practices, and practices of bodily and self maintenance. As the most comprehensive account to date of the varied interpretations of cultural capital that have been developed in the wake of Bourdieu’s work, Culture, Class, Distinction offers the first systematic assessment of the relationships between cultural practice and the social divisions of class, gender and ethnicity in contemporary Britain.
It is essential reading for anyone interested in the relationships between culture and society.},

	abstract = {American political scientist Robert Putnam wasn’t the first person to recognize that social capital – the relationships between people that allow communities to function well – is the grease that oils the wheels of society. But by publishing Bowling Alone, he moved the debate from one primarily concerned with family and individual relationships one that studied the social capital generated by people’s engagement with the civic life.
Putnam drew heavily on the critical thinking skill of interpretation in shaping his work. He took fresh looks at the meaning of evidence that other scholars had made too many assumptions about, and was scrupulous in clarifying what his evidence was really saying. He found that strong social capital has the power to boost health, lower unemployment, and improve life in major ways. As such, any decrease in civic engagement could create serious consequences for society.
Putnam’s interpretation of these issues led him to the understanding that if America is to thrive, its citizens must connect.

For this purpose, multivariate analysis, and in particular, multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), has been chosen as the preferred statistical method to support a theory of ‘homology’ between ‘social position’ and preferences. This article reassesses the initial interpretation offered by Bourdieu of the two factor spaces of ‘dominant’ and ‘petit-bourgeois’ tastes in Distinction (1979) and discusses how MCA is used in the sociology of culture as ‘structural homology’, especially one-dimensionally (single-axis reduction) and positionally, without the inclusion of the age variable. The two ways of considering the effect of age are either by excluding it a priori (‘omitted axis’) or by not theorizing it (‘descriptive axis’). We show, using data from the 2008 French Cultural Practices survey on tastes in music and movies, how a factor analysis that incorporates age outlines a generational and historical structuring of tastes. We explain the different dimensions of age in terms of cultural practices and we interpret the level of education in terms of knowledge. The article advocates a model for the interpretation of tastes that is no longer based on the structure of capital, but rather on cultural history and specific competences.},
