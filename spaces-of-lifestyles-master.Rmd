abstract: "Have the ways in which cultural practices are socially structured changed over the last 10–15 years, a period marked by digitization of cultural consumption and production? This paper tackles this question by analyzing two repeated nationally representative surveys, collected in Finland in 2007 (N=1,388) and 2018 (N=1,425), allowing comparisons over time and including a wide set of indicators of cultural practices. Applying Specific Multiple Correspondence Analysis (SpeMCA), the paper sets out to construct the space of lifestyles – or, “cultural map” – in Finland in both 2007 and 2018. The analysis carried out, inspired by the few studies having used MCA in analyzing temporal changes, includes three steps. First, the space of lifestyles is constructed individually for 2007 and 2018 using more than 100 lifestyle indicators. The second step is to include observations from 2018 to the SpeMCA-model of 2007 as supplementary individuals, and examine the change happened during 11 years in the space of lifestyles, both in the scale of the whole cultural map and individual lifestyle indicators. The third step is to build more comprehensive space of lifestyles for 2018 data, using additional indicators of social media and other online and offline everyday activities. The results are discussed in the light of other recent research focusing on the temporal dynamics of cultural stratification in different national contexts."
